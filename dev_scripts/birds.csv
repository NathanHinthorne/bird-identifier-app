Their call is a series of high-pitched whistling or piping notes, quite different from the fierce scream often associated with them in popular media (which is actually the call of a Red-tailed Hawk). These birds are also known for their spectacular courtship displays, which involve locking talons in mid-air and spinning as they fall.","Bald Eagles are closely associated with water bodies, so look for them near lakes, rivers, coastal areas, and other large open water sources. They're often seen perched high in tall trees overlooking water, providing them with a good vantage point for spotting fish, their primary prey. During winter, they may gather in large numbers where food is abundant, such as salmon runs or areas with high concentrations of waterfowl. Use binoculars or a spotting scope to scan the tops of tall trees near water. Watch for their distinctive soaring flight, with wings held flat like a board.

In the Pacific Northwest, look for them along sandy beaches, mudflats, and salt marshes. They're often seen wading in shallow water or probing the mud with their bills in search of small invertebrates. During the breeding season, some Willets can be found in inland wetlands and prairies east of the Cascade Mountains. Listen for their distinctive calls, which are often the first sign of their presence. Willets are generally active throughout the day, but early morning and late afternoon can be particularly good times for observation. They're often seen in small groups, sometimes mixed with other shorebird species. Good places to look for Willets in the Pacific Northwest include coastal estuaries like Willapa Bay in Washington and Tillamook Bay in Oregon. During migration (spring and fall), they may be seen in larger numbers as birds from the interior population pass through.

It has olive-brown upperparts and pale underparts, with two whitish wing bars and a pale eye ring. Its bill is wide and flat, adapted for catching flying insects. While its appearance may be understated, its vocalizations are distinctive. The Willow Flycatcher's song is a sneezy ""fitz-bew"" or ""fitz-be-yew,"" which is often described as sounding like ""creet-creet-creet."" This emphatic song is key to identifying this species, as it can be difficult to distinguish visually from other small flycatchers. During the breeding season, males sing persistently to defend their territories and attract mates. They also have a sharp ""whit"" call note that they use frequently.","Willow Flycatchers, living up to their name, prefer habitats with dense, low vegetation, particularly near water. In the Pacific Northwest, look for them in willow thickets, alder groves, and other shrubby areas along streams, wetlands, and meadow edges. They're summer residents in the region, typically arriving in late May and departing by September. The best way to locate Willow Flycatchers is by listening for their distinctive song, which they give frequently during the breeding season, especially in the early morning and evening. Once you hear them, scan the tops of small trees and tall shrubs, where males often perch to sing. Watch for their characteristic flycatcher behavior: flying out from a perch to catch an insect, then returning to the same or a nearby perch. Good places to look for Willow Flycatchers in the Pacific Northwest include riparian areas in the Willamette Valley of Oregon and the shrub-steppe regions of eastern Washington.

It has a round body, short legs, and an extremely long, straight bill used for probing soft mud for invertebrates. The bird's back is mottled with brown, black, and buff stripes, while the underparts are white with heavy brown barring on the sides. Its head has bold black and buff stripes running lengthwise. One of the most distinctive features of Wilson's Snipe is its large, dark eyes set far back on its head, giving it a 360-degree field of vision. During courtship displays, males produce a haunting, wavering sound called winnowing. This is created by air rushing through their outspread tail feathers as they dive repeatedly during flight. Their vocal calls include a sharp, raspy ""scaipe"" often given when flushed.","Wilson's Snipe inhabit wet, marshy areas with dense, low vegetation. In the Pacific Northwest, look for them in freshwater marshes, wet meadows, bogs, and along the edges of ponds and streams. These birds are masters of camouflage and often remain motionless when approached, relying on their cryptic coloration to avoid detection. The best way to find them is to walk slowly through suitable habitat, watching for birds that flush suddenly from the ground. They typically fly in a zig-zag pattern when startled. During the breeding season (late spring to summer), listen for the winnowing sound of displaying males, especially at dawn and dusk. This sound carries well and can help locate territories. In winter, Wilson's Snipe may gather in small groups in unfrozen wetlands or along spring-fed streams. Good places to look for them in the Pacific Northwest include wildlife refuges with extensive wetlands, such as the Ridgefield National Wildlife Refuge in Washington or the Klamath Marsh National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. Early morning and late afternoon are often the best times for observation.
