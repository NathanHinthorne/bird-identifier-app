Bald Eagles are known for their impressive size, with a wingspan that can exceed 7 feet. Their call is a series of high-pitched whistling or piping notes, quite different from the fierce scream often associated with them in popular media (which is actually the call of a Red-tailed Hawk). These birds are also known for their spectacular courtship displays, which involve locking talons in mid-air and spinning as they fall.","Bald Eagles are closely associated with water bodies, so look for them near lakes, rivers, coastal areas, and other large open water sources. They're often seen perched high in tall trees overlooking water, providing them with a good vantage point for spotting fish, their primary prey. During winter, they may gather in large numbers where food is abundant, such as salmon runs or areas with high concentrations of waterfowl. Use binoculars or a spotting scope to scan the tops of tall trees near water. Watch for their distinctive soaring flight, with wings held flat like a board. Bald Eagles are active during daylight hours, with increased activity in the early morning and late afternoon. During breeding season, look for their massive stick nests high in trees near water.

Look for males perched in trees or on the ground in small clearings. Females are more secretive and are usually found on the forest floor, where they nest and raise their young. In late summer and fall, Sooty Grouse often move to areas with abundant berries. During winter, they may be found high in conifer trees, feeding on needles. When hiking in suitable habitat, watch for movement on the ground or in trees, and listen for the rustling of leaves as these large birds move through the underbrush.

The underwings are silvery, creating a distinctive flashing effect as the bird banks and turns in flight. Its bill is long, thin, and dark, with tubular nostrils adapted for excreting excess salt. Sooty Shearwaters are usually silent at sea, but on their breeding grounds they produce an eerie, wailing call. Their flight is characterized by long glides on stiff wings, punctuated by several quick wingbeats, a typical shearwater pattern.","Sooty Shearwaters are pelagic birds, meaning they spend most of their lives at sea, coming to land only to breed. In North America, they can be observed from both the Pacific and Atlantic coasts during their migration. The best way to see them is on a pelagic birding trip, which takes birders several miles offshore. Look for them skimming low over the waves, often in large flocks that can number in the thousands. They're most numerous off the Pacific Coast in late summer and fall as they begin their southward migration. From shore, they can sometimes be seen during ""seawatches"" from coastal promontories, especially on days with onshore winds. Watch for their distinctive flight pattern: long glides interrupted by quick bursts of wingbeats. They often follow fishing boats, so areas with active fishing fleets can be good spots to check.

Spotted Owls are known for their low, deep hooting call, typically a series of four hoots with the middle two closer together, often described as ""hoo, hoo-hoo, hooo."" They also produce a variety of whistles, barks, and screams, particularly during the breeding season.","Spotted Owls are primarily found in mature and old-growth forests, particularly in the Pacific Northwest and the Southwest. They prefer dense forest habitats with a complex structure that includes multiple canopy layers and many large trees. Due to their nocturnal habits and preference for dense forest, Spotted Owls can be challenging to observe. The best way to locate them is by their vocalizations, which are most frequent just after sunset and before sunrise during the breeding season (late winter to early spring). Listen for their distinctive four-note hooting call. During the day, they roost in dense foliage or tree cavities, so careful scanning of large trees in suitable habitat might reveal a roosting owl. Look for whitewash (droppings) and pellets beneath potential roost sites. Because of their threatened status, it's crucial to minimize disturbance when searching for Spotted Owls. Many areas where they occur require special permits for owl surveys.

They hold their wings in a slight V-shape when soaring, rocking side to side as they glide. Their bald head, which can change color with the bird's emotional state, is an adaptation for their carrion-eating lifestyle. Unlike many birds of prey, Turkey Vultures have a highly developed sense of smell, which they use to locate carrion. They are generally silent, but can hiss or grunt when disturbed.","Turkey Vultures are widespread and can be found in a variety of habitats, from wilderness areas to suburbs.

Look for them along highways, where they may be feeding on roadkill, or perched on fence posts and dead trees, often with their wings spread to warm in the sun. In urban and suburban areas, they may gather on cell towers or other tall structures. Early mornings are a good time to spot them as they warm up and begin to seek thermals. During migration, they can form large kettles (groups of soaring birds) that can number in the hundreds or even thousands.

The best time to spot them is during low tide when they actively forage among the rocks and tidepools. Listen for their distinctive call, which they often give in flight. Wandering Tattlers are solitary birds, so you'll typically see them alone or in small groups. They can be quite approachable, allowing for good views if you move slowly and quietly.
