In urban and suburban areas, look for them foraging on lawns, building nests on sturdy branches or in sheltered spots on buildings.

Watch for their characteristic behavior of flicking their long tails as they move through vegetation.

Their plumage is a masterful blend of colors - a peachy brown head fading to soft gray on the back, accented by a pale yellow belly. The bird's most striking features include a rakish black mask, reminiscent of a bandit, and a bright yellow band tipping its tail. Both males and females share this refined appearance. Their voice is equally distinctive - a high-pitched, soft trilled whistle that often goes unnoticed amidst their busy foraging.","Cedar Waxwings are social creatures, often seen in large flocks, especially when berries are abundant. Look for them in open woodlands, suburban parks, and other areas rich in fruit-bearing trees and shrubs. They're particularly fond of cedar trees (hence their name), but also frequent other species like juniper, serviceberry, and mulberry. During breeding season, listen for their high-pitched whistles in treed areas. In winter, watch for roving flocks descending on berry-laden shrubs or fruit trees. These birds are also attracted to water features, so keep an eye out near bird baths or small ponds. Their gregarious nature and distinctive appearance make them a delight to observe when you encounter a feeding flock.",,,,

This warm coloration contrasts beautifully with its gray wings, crisp white cheeks, and sooty-brown cap. Unlike its black-capped cousins, this chickadee's vocalizations are unique - a series of husky, squeaky calls reminiscent of baby birds. They're skilled excavators, capable of creating nesting cavities in very soft wood, but they're equally happy to adopt nest boxes.","These chickadees are lovers of dense, damp evergreen forests, but they also frequent oak woodlands and streamside willows. In coastal areas, look for them higher up in coniferous trees, while in more urban settings, they may descend to shrub level in yards and park borders. Listen for their distinctive calls, which differ notably from the classic ""chick-a-dee"" of other species. Their propensity for nest boxes means they might become regular visitors if you provide suitable housing.

These hawks are known for their swift, maneuverable flight through woodland obstacles.","Cooper's Hawks have adapted well to human-altered landscapes, making them increasingly common in suburban and even urban environments. Look for them perched in trees along forest edges or swooping through neighborhoods. They're often spotted near bird feeders, where they hunt smaller birds. During breeding season, listen for their repeated ""cak-cak-cak"" calls. Watch for their distinctive flight pattern: several quick wingbeats followed by a glide.

Males are particularly striking, with a glossy black cap contrasting sharply with their bright yellow underparts. Their backs can vary from olive green to black, depending on the geographic location. Females and immature birds are more subdued, with olive-green upper parts and yellowish underparts. These birds are a bundle of energy, often seen in small, chattering flocks. Their song is a long, rambling series of twitters and warbles, sometimes incorporating mimicry of other bird species.","Lesser Goldfinches are birds of open, brushy habitats. Look for them in areas with a mix of trees and open spaces, particularly where there are plenty of seed-bearing plants. They're especially fond of sunflower family plants, so weedy fields and roadsides can be excellent spots to find them. In suburban areas, they're often attracted to bird feeders, particularly those offering nyjer (thistle) seeds. Listen for their constant chatter and twittering songs, which can help locate flocks even when the birds are hidden in foliage. They're often seen in mixed flocks with other finch species, so carefully scan any group of small, active birds you encounter. During breeding season, watch for males performing undulating flight displays to attract mates. These charming little birds are also fond of water, so keep an eye out near bird baths or small streams in appropriate habitat.",,,,

Hidden in its wings and tail is a flash of bright yellow, visible when the bird is in flight or stretching. Slightly smaller than their goldfinch cousins, Pine Siskins have a more slender build and a sharply pointed bill perfect for extracting seeds from cones. Their overall brown, heavily streaked appearance provides excellent camouflage among the coniferous trees they favor. What truly sets them apart is their vocalization - a distinctive rising ""zreeeeeet"" call that's quite different from the clear whistles of goldfinches.","Pine Siskins are nomadic birds, their presence often unpredictable from one year to the next. Look for them in coniferous forests, where they feed on seeds in treetops. However, they're also frequent visitors to suburban areas and parks, especially in winter. Listen for their distinctive calls, which can help you locate flocks even before you see them. They often mix with other finch species, so carefully scan goldfinch flocks for these streakier cousins. Bird feeders can be a great attraction - they're particularly fond of nyjer (thistle) seeds and hulled sunflower seeds. In winter, watch for them at suet feeders as well.

Listen for their sweet, variable song, which males deliver frequently from exposed perches.

Males are particularly striking with their bright yellow plumage and distinctive black cap, which looks like a small skullcap perched atop their head. Females share the vibrant yellow coloration but typically lack the black cap or have a much reduced version. Their song is a rapid series of descending notes, often described as ""che-che-che-che-cheh,"" accelerating and rising in volume towards the end.","In the western United States, Wilson's Warblers are common summer residents in moist, shrubby habitats. Look for them in willow groves, alder thickets, and along the edges of woodlands, particularly near water. They're active foragers, often seen flitting about in the lower to middle parts of trees and shrubs, gleaning insects from leaves. During migration, they can turn up in a variety of habitats, including parks and gardens. Listen for their fast-paced, chattering song, which males deliver frequently during breeding season. Their preference for lower vegetation means they're often more visible than some other warbler species. Watch for their quick, darting movements and the flash of bright yellow among the leaves.",,,,

Males during breeding season have a green crest, a red eye, a white chin, brown chest, yellow belly, and black-and-blue wings. Females are overall brown with white dots on chest, a white chin, and a white ring around its eye. Nonbreeding males are mostly brown with red eyes.",,,,,

In the western ""Audubon's"" subspecies, common in the Pacific Northwest, the throat is also yellow. These warblers are larger and chunkier than many of their warbler cousins. Their call is a soft ""chek,"" and their song is a series of sweet trilled notes.","Yellow-rumped Warblers are adaptable birds, found in a variety of habitats. During migration and winter, look for them in open woodlands, edges of forests, parks, and even residential areas. They're often seen flitting from perch to perch, hawking insects from the air or gleaning them from foliage. In winter, they're one of the few warblers able to digest the wax in bayberries and wax myrtles, so check berry-producing shrubs. Listen for their soft ""chek"" call, which they give frequently while foraging. During breeding season, they move to coniferous forests, often at higher elevations. Unlike many warblers, Yellow-rumped Warblers will visit bird feeders, particularly those offering suet or small seeds.",,,,
