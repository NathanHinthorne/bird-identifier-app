They have large, round heads with no ear tufts, piercing yellow eyes, and feathered feet adapted for the cold Arctic environment. Their massive size—they can have a wingspan up to 5 feet—makes them one of the largest owls in North America. Unlike many owl species, Snowy Owls are diurnal, often active during daylight hours. They are generally silent away from their breeding grounds, but may occasionally give a deep, raspy ""kroo-kroo"" call or a harsh, grating shriek when alarmed.","While Snowy Owls breed in the high Arctic, they are best known to most birdwatchers as winter visitors to open habitats in northern North America. During irruption years, when populations move south in large numbers, they can be found even further south. Look for them in wide-open spaces that resemble their tundra homes: coastal beaches and dunes, open fields, airports, and large grasslands. They often perch conspicuously on the ground or on slight rises, fence posts, or other low structures. Unlike most owls, Snowy Owls are active during the day, especially in the low light of dawn and dusk. Their white plumage makes them stand out against most backgrounds, but they can be surprisingly well-camouflaged on snowy landscapes. When searching, scan open areas carefully and look for a large, white shape. In flight, watch for steady, powerful wingbeats with occasional glides.
