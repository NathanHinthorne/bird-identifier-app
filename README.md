# Bird Identification App

## Description

## Structure

This app (the frontend) uses Firebase to store birds identified by each user, wheras the API (the backend) has a PostGreSQL database for storing all birds (by region) in the US.

## Installation for Development

### Android

After building, go to the android folder and run the following command:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## Ideas for Future Features

- Animation of birds perched on UI buttons that flutter away when clicked.
  
- A "bird book" animation instead of a list for Life List section. Users will be able to flip through to see all the birds they've identified. Maybe just keep this "bird book" inside the paired bird game since it would cause problems in the app.

- Replacing all UI elements with SVG pixel art. This would be done to match the style of the paired bird game.

## Credits

A big thank you to my following friends for their contributions to this project:
  
- Natan for his witty success text that appears when a bird is identified, such as: "THAT THERE BE A BIRD", "U HAS FOUND BIRD", and "BIRD OBTAINED".
  
- Arsh for the random, but brilliant idea of pairing a game with bird identification. 

- And most importantly **Ethan!!!** For his collection of over 600 bird images he spent years personally photographing and organizing.
