# Bird Identification App

## Description

## Structure

This app (the frontend) uses Firebase to store birds identified by each user, wheras the API (the backend) has a PostGreSQL database for storing all birds (by region) in the US.

## Installation for Development

### Android

After building, go to the android folder and run the following command:

```bash
gradlew assembleDebug
``` 


## Ideas for Future Features

- Animation of birds perched on UI buttons that flutter away when clicked.
  
## Credits

A big thank you to my following friends for their contributions to this project:
  
- Natan for his witty success text that appears when a bird is identified, such as: "THAT THERE BE A BIRD", "U HAS FOUND BIRD", and "BIRD OBTAINED".
  
- Arsh for the idea of pairing a game with bird identification.

- And most importantly **Ethan!!!** for his help writing bird descriptions and his contribution of over 100 bird images he spent years personally photographing and organizing. You can find a wonderful wildlife book he wrote [here on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Masterpieces-Evergreen-State-Narration-Washington/dp/B09GCXXTBX). I would highly recommend checking it out!
